JavaScript Solutions to Puzzles
============

An ever expanding collection of my solutions to common programming puzzles that I stumble upon. Predominantly in JavaScript.

How do I hack on these?
=======

Found a better solution? That's great news, please show me!

There is a full suite of tests to help. Each solution comes with it's own spec. If you can improve these then that would be great.

```
git clone https://github.com/dannycroft/puzzle-solutions
```

```
cd puzzle-solutions
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm test
```

Why?
=======

Because I like to hack on things. It clears my mind, relaxes me and helps me focus.
